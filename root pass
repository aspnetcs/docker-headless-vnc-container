docker run -d --user 0 -p 5901:5901 -p 6901:6901 consol/centos-xfce-vnc

Could you please specify what you're trying to achieve?
Do you want to switch to the root user for a running container?

If so, you could either run a new container with --user 0 flag

docker run -d --user 0 -p 5901:5901 -p 6901:6901 consol/centos-xfce-vnc
or you could switch users when executing a command on a running container

docker exec -it -u 0 <container_id> bash
